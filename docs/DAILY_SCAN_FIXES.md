# Daily Scan Security Fixes Documentation

## Problem Summary
The daily scan was generating false positives by:
1. Scanning its own report files created in `/tmp`
2. Detecting previously deleted files that no longer existed
3. Incorrectly filtering files AFTER scanning instead of BEFORE

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Self-Detection
- **Problem**: Reports were created in `/tmp/daily_scan_alert_*.html`
- **Impact**: YARA would scan these reports and flag them as suspicious
- **Fix**: Reports now saved in `${YARA_LOGS_DIR}` directory

### Issue 2: Post-Scan Filtering
- **Problem**: Line 60 in `daily_scan.sh` ran YARA on ALL files, then filtered output
- **Impact**: Files were scanned even if they should be excluded
- **Fix**: Build exclusion list BEFORE running YARA

### Issue 3: Improper File Cleanup
- **Problem**: Script was deleting potential evidence from `/tmp`
- **Impact**: Lost forensic data, destroyed potential malware samples
- **Fix**: Implemented quarantine instead of deletion

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Pre-Scan Exclusion Logic
```bash
# Build find command with proper exclusions BEFORE scanning
FIND_CMD="find \"$dir\" -type f"

# Add pattern exclusions
for pattern in $EXCLUDE_PATTERNS; do
    FIND_CMD="$FIND_CMD -not -name \"$pattern\""
done

# Create filtered file list
eval "$FIND_CMD" > "$TEMP_FILE_LIST"

# Run YARA only on filtered files
```

### 2. Quarantine Implementation
```bash
QUARANTINE_DIR="/opt/yara/quarantine"
QUARANTINE_DATE_DIR="$QUARANTINE_DIR/$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# Move malicious files to quarantine
mv "$file_path" "$QUARANTINE_FILE"
chmod 600 "$QUARANTINE_FILE"

# Save threat metadata
echo "Detection Rule: $rule_name" > "${QUARANTINE_FILE}.info"
echo "SHA256: $(sha256sum)" >> "${QUARANTINE_FILE}.info"
```

### 3. Exclusion Patterns
```bash
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS="daily_scan_alert_*.html yara_scan_*.html test_*.html *.yar *.yara agentid_row.txt"
EXCLUDE_DIRS="/opt/yara/rules /opt/yara/backup /opt/yara/reports"
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Essential Rules Only
- Daily scans use subset of critical rules
- Full rule set reserved for comprehensive scans
- Timeout protection (2s per file, 60s total)

### Batch Processing
- Files processed in controlled batches
- Memory-efficient scanning
- Prevents system overload

## Security Best Practices

### Never Delete Suspicious Files
- All detections go to quarantine
- Preserves evidence for analysis
- Maintains forensic integrity

### Quarantine Structure
```
/opt/yara/quarantine/
├── 20250908/
│   ├── malware.exe.quarantine.120530_1234
│   ├── malware.exe.quarantine.120530_1234.info
│   └── ...
```

### Permissions
- Quarantine directory: 700 (root only)
- Quarantined files: 600 (read/write root only)
- Prevents accidental execution

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Clean System Test
```bash
./scripts/daily_scan.sh
# Should complete without false positives
```

### 2. Malware Detection Test
```bash
# Create EICAR test file
echo 'X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*' > /tmp/test.txt
./scripts/daily_scan.sh
# Should detect and quarantine
```

### 3. Verify Quarantine
```bash
ls -la /opt/yara/quarantine/$(date +%Y%m%d)/
# Should show quarantined files with .info metadata
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Log Files
- Daily scan logs: `/var/log/yara/daily_scan_YYYYMMDD.log`
- Email reports: Sent to `soc@goline.ch`
- Quarantine info: `.info` files with each quarantined item

### Scheduled Tasks
- Daily scan: 2:00 AM via cron
- Log rotation: Keep 30 days
- Quarantine cleanup: Manual review required

## Distribution to Servers

### Update Procedure
1. Test on local server first
2. Verify no false positives
3. Backup current scripts
4. Deploy via `update_scripts_all_servers.sh`
5. Monitor first execution on remote servers

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# Restore from backup if issues
tar -xzf /opt/yara/backup/$(date +%Y%m%d)/scripts_fixed_*.tar.gz -C /opt/yara/
```
